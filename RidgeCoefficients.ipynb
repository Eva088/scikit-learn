    "This example also shows the usefuness of applying Ridge Regression to highly ill-conditioned matrices. For such matrices, a slight change in the target variable can cause huge variances in the calculated weights. In such cases, it is useful to set a certain regularization (alpha) to reduce this variation (noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher alpha leads to underfitting and lower alpha leads to overfitting. If alpha = 0, the model behaves like an OLS model (coefficients exhibit big oscillations). In practice, it is necessary to tune alpha in such a way that a balance is maintained between regularization effect and minimizing the squared loss function. \n"
